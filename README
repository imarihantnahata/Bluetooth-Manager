This application is an Android Bluetooth utility application. The user can send and receive messages,small text files and 
chat with other Bluetooth enabled Android devices running the app. 

The application will try to send data to the destination device even if it is not available within its reach by a reactive 
routing protocol (based on the DYMO protocol). A connection with multiple hops is established if the topology is available.
